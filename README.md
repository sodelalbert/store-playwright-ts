## Github Actions CI/CD

This project is set up with a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). The workflow is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file and is triggered on push and pull request events.

### Static Code Analysis and Formatting

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for static code analysis and formatting. You can run the following commands to check and format the code:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run format
npm run lint
```

You can also run all checks at once using:

```bash
npm run check:all
```

Failed test cases will contain screenshots,trace files and video recordings for further analysis.

### Test Execution

The GitHub Actions workflow installs the necessary dependencies, sets up the environment, and runs the Playwright tests. It also generates and uploads test reports and artifacts for failed tests.

Test Report Artifacts (HTML report with embeded screenshots and videos from failed tests) can be accessed from the Actions tab in the GitHub repository after the workflow completes.
